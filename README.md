# Dakar-hacking-spots
Kick-ass hacking spots in Dakar (Senegal)

Have never heard of Dakar? Well, you can think of it as the nose of Africa. [Check it out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar)

Time's cafe

### Etiquette
The restaurants/cafes will gladly give you the wifi code if you order something reasonable. (example: esspresso + 2 croissants = 2,200 CFA about $4).

### Higher level goals

I do believe Dakar can be the next great tech hub. The weather is great. The internet is fast enough for your git clones/pushs, npm install, yarn... whatever floats your boat. And the standard living is super-duper cheap (compare that to San Fran :sunglasses:). 

There are other Hacking spots repos around the world but this one is entirely focused on Dakar. Once I am happy with the list, hopefully more than 15 quality hacking spots, I'll move the repo to an organization.

### Want to Contribute

Awesome. [open an issue](https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/Dakar-hacking-spots/issues/new) with the infos. I'll fact check then include it.
